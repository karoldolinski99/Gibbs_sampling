# Gibbs_sampling

The project has been done in R language.

Gibbs sampling is a Monte Carlo Markov chain (MCMC) algorithm for obtaining sequences of observations that are approximated from a particular multivariate probability distribution when direct sampling is difficult. The aim of the project is to present the steps of the Gibbs algorithm and to compare the obtained results.
